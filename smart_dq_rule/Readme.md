Smart DQ Rule System
====================
A revolutionary approach to data quality management that employs machine learning and pattern analysis to automatically suggest and implement DQ rules.

What is this?
==============
Ever spent hours manually defining data quality rules for your tables? This project aims to fix that. The Smart DQ Rule system analyzes your database columns, automatically identifies PII data, and suggests appropriate data quality rules based on historical patterns in your data.

Folder Purposes
===============
classifiers: 
Contains all the code related to automatic classification of columns as PII or non-PII. This is where our rule-based and ML-based approaches determine if your data contains sensitive information.

profilers:
Houses the data profiling components that analyze 6 months of historical data to discover patterns, distributions, and anomalies. The PySpark and PyDeequ integration happens here.

rule_engines: 
The brains of the operation - takes the outputs from classification and profiling to generate appropriate data quality rules, prioritize them, and prepare them for implementation.
utils: 
Shared functionality like database connectors, logging, monitoring metrics, and other helper functions that support the main components.

config: 
Configuration files for different environments, default rule sets, and system parameters. Modify these to adapt the system to your specific needs.

tests: 
Comprehensive test suite to ensure stability and correctness as the system evolves. Includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests for end-to-end flows.

examples: 
Ready-to-run examples and notebooks that demonstrate how to use the system in real-world scenarios. Great starting point for new users.

Key Features
============
Automatic PII Detection: Identifies personally identifiable information without manual tagging
Historical Data Analysis: Studies 6 months of data to understand patterns and detect anomalies
Intelligent Rule Suggestion: Recommends DQ rules based on data characteristics
Scalable Processing: Built on PySpark to handle datasets of any size
Plug-and-Play Architecture: Modular design makes it easy to extend or customize

Getting Started
================
Install the required dependencies:
Copypip install -r requirements.txt

Configure your database connection in config/database.json
Run a quick test to ensure everything's working:
Copypython -m smart_dq_rule.tests.quick_test

Check out the examples directory for usage examples

Development
===========
Want to contribute? Great! This project follows a modular architecture designed for extension. If you want to add new features:

New classifiers go in the classifiers directory
