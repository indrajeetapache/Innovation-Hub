Absolutely, let’s break it down like a story you can confidently present to an audience — technical but human-friendly:

### 🧠 **How Our Anomaly Detection System Works: A Story for Curious Minds**

Imagine you’re a security guard watching over two important gauges every day: **Balance** and **Market Condition**. These gauges record values every hour. Most of the time, they behave predictably — ups and downs that follow familiar patterns like weekdays vs weekends, or month start vs month end.

But sometimes, something odd happens — a sudden jump, a weird dip, or a completely off rhythm. That’s when our anomaly detection system kicks in.

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ **Step 1: Learn What “Normal” Looks Like**

First, we show our model lots of normal behavior. It observes patterns like:

* How values fluctuate daily (seasonality)
* How much they usually change (volatility)
* Trends and average levels

We feed it this history using a sliding window — say 14 time steps at a time — like watching two weeks of activity to predict what should come next.

### 🛠️ **Step 2: Three-Layer Anomaly Brain**

To catch anomalies, we don’t rely on just one trick. We use **three intelligent layers** — each looking at the data in a different way:

---

#### 🔍 **Layer 1: Statistical Rules (The Math Teacher)**

This layer checks if a value is:

* Way above or below the normal range (using Z-score or IQR)
* Showing abnormal trend shifts
* Becoming more or less volatile than usual

If the math doesn’t like what it sees, it raises a flag.

---

#### 📅 **Layer 2: Seasonal Checks (The Calendar Whisperer)**

This layer asks: “Should a spike happen on a **Tuesday**, or during **month-end**?”

It understands:

* Weekly habits (e.g., sales every Friday)
* Monthly patterns (e.g., budgets spike at month-end)
* Whether today’s value is unusual **for this point in time**

If your value is weird *for the day*, it gets flagged.

---

#### 🤖 **Layer 3: Deep Learning (The Neural Network Detective)**

Here comes the LSTM Autoencoder. It learns to **reconstruct** what “should” happen from past patterns.

Here’s what it does:

* Takes 14 past values → predicts what the 15th should look like
* Compares the prediction to what actually happened
* If the error (reconstruction difference) is big — it screams **anomaly!**

The threshold for “too different” is calculated using a **Gaussian distribution** over all errors.

---

### 🎯 **Step 3: Combine and Conclude**

Each layer gives its own list of suspicious moments.

The system merges these into a final verdict:

* If multiple layers agree, confidence increases
* We mark those moments clearly on visual plots: red for combined, orange for statistical, green for seasonal, purple for ML-based

---

### 🧾 **What You See in the Charts**

* **Training History**: Loss reduces until early stopping kicks in — no further gain.
* **Reconstruction Plot**: Model shows how close (or far) it got in recreating the actual values.
* **Anomaly Timeline**: You see spikes where different layers spotted trouble. Those red dots? That’s where the system says, “This is weird — you should look here.”

---

### 🗃️ **Final Output**

For each column like `balance` or `market_condition`, you get:

* Total anomalies
* Their timestamps
* Their original values
* Categorization by detection type

You can now export these or flag them for further business investigation.
