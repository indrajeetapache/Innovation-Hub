### 📊 **How We’re Catching Unusual Patterns in the Data**

Let’s say we’re watching metrics like `balance` or `market_condition` over time. Most of the time, these values look normal. But once in a while, **something strange happens** — a spike, a dip, or a pattern break. That’s what we call an **anomaly**.

To catch these automatically, we don’t just use one technique. We use **two different brains** — and then combine them to decide what’s truly worth flagging.

### 🧠 1. Deep Learning (LSTM Autoencoder) – Think of it like “Memory”

We train a model to **remember how normal days look** by showing it regular patterns in the time series.

* It tries to **rebuild (reconstruct)** each day’s data.
* If a day is “too weird,” it can’t rebuild it properly — and that’s when the **error spikes**.
* These spikes are flagged as **LSTM anomalies** (you saw them as green dots in the graph).

📌 *Good at learning flowing patterns, but can be fooled if too much noise exists in training.*

---

### 🔍 2. Statistical Models (PYOD) – Think of it like “Math-Based Filtering”

Here, we don’t teach the model anything. Instead, we **measure how far off each data point is from the rest**.

* These are models like **ECOD or COPOD**, which look for values that are statistically too far from the average.
* If a point is out-of-place, it gets flagged as a **PYOD anomaly** (red dots).

📌 *Fast, works out of the box, but doesn’t understand time or trends.*

### 🧩 3. Putting Both Together – A Smart Voting System

Each method has strengths. Sometimes they **catch different types of problems**.

* If **either** model finds a problem → it's an *“all possible anomalies”* list.
* If **both agree** → we call that a *“consensus anomaly”* (purple dots).
* We can also use **scores** from each model to blend and pick the top risks.

You chose to use the **consensus method** — so you’re only keeping the anomalies that **both models agree on**. These are the safest, most confident detections.

### 🖼️ What You’re Seeing in the Charts

Each chart shows one column like `balance` or `market_condition` over time.

* **Blue line** = The normal flow of data.
* **Green dots** = LSTM saw something weird.
* **Red dots** = PYOD saw something weird.
* **Purple dots** = Both saw something weird — these are **your most trustworthy flags**.

---

### 🔎 Example: `market_condition`

* Most data is between -2 and +2.
* Red and green dots are scattered — showing each model is catching its own types of odd behavior.
* The **purple dots (112 of them)** are high-confidence outliers — real anomalies where both models agreed.

---

### 🔎 Example: `balance`

* We see **huge spikes** in values — possibly payments or abnormal fund movements.
* LSTM flags almost all spikes.
* PYOD flags only extreme ones.
* Where both agree, you get a **tight group of real issues worth looking into**.

---

### 🛠️ How It Works Internally (But Still Simply):

1. LSTM tries to rebuild normal patterns. When it fails badly → that’s a flag.
2. PYOD looks for weird data points based on math (how far it is from the rest).
3. Fusion logic takes both outputs and does one of:

   * Union: All anomalies caught by either.
   * Intersection: Only anomalies agreed on.
   * Weighted: Score-based ranking from both models.

---

### 🧠 Why This Works Well

* **LSTM sees patterns over time** — perfect for trend changes, spikes, drifts.
* **PYOD sees statistical outliers** — great for sudden value jumps or rare values.
* Together, they **balance each other out**, giving you:

  * More coverage
  * More confidence
  * Less noise

### 🏁 Final Thought

 **hybrid anomaly detection system** that:

* Combines deep learning with statistical logic
* Flags important issues that would be missed by rule-based systems
* Can be **explained to business** with clear visual evidence
